## üìù Design

Before starting coding, I needed to have some overall idea of how I wanted the application to look like. The requirements define that:

- The user should be able to see an image of a cat, as offered by the API.
- The user should be able to vote up or down a given image of a cat, as identified by the API.
- The user should be able to see the breed of the cat as an overlay in the image. The app should show some info about the breed as they click on it.
- The user should be able to filter by breed.

So with this in mind, I go to [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) and starting making a mockup of the application. I want it to be easy to use, so I want to use a visual language that is more or less ubiquitous. Since the website has a very simple yes/no interface, it makes sense to use a Tinder-like UX. Also it is a good time to define a basic logo. 

For the logo I used the iOS icon template of Sketch, to which I overimposed a kitty icon I found on Iconfinder.
