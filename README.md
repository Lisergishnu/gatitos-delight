# Gatitos Delight (Kitty delight)
iOS cat sightseeing up for Felcana. Works with thecatapi.com 

## üìù Design

Before starting coding, I needed to have some overall idea of how I wanted the application to look like. The requirements define that:

- The user should be able to see an image of a cat, as offered by the API.
- The user should be able to vote up or down a given image of a cat, as identified by the API.
- The user should be able to see the breed of the cat as an overlay in the image. The app should show some info about the breed as they click on it.
- The user should be able to filter by breed.
